# Creating a Chart with Animated Background

This project shows how to build a data-rich chart (token limits, prices, and model release dates) and overlay it on an animated scene for maximum visual impact.

## Final Result

<div style="text-align: center;">

  <img src="./video/gpt-claude-gemini-3000.aep_AME/gpt-claude-gemini-animated-background-3000.gif" alt="SLM Comparison by Knowledge Cutoff Date, Max Tokens, and Price" width="1000" />

    Chart with Animated Background Served via Git LFS â€“ It Might Take a Minute to Load
  </p>

</div>

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yauheniya-ai/animated-chart-background
cd animated-chart-background

# Create virtual environment (recommended: use uv for speed)
uv venv --python=3.12
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open `gpt-claude-gemini.ipynb` in your IDE or in Jupyter
2. Run all cells to load the data and generate the chart
3. Open your video editing software (e.g. Adobe After Effects, Adobe Express) and place the chart (with transparent background) over the background video
4. Export as a looping GIF or MP4
5. For sharing large GIF files, use Git LFS (see below)


## Git Large File Storage (LFS) 

```bash
brew install git-lfs

# Update global git config
git lfs install

# Select the file types you'd like Git LFS to manage
git lfs track "*.gif"

# Make sure .gitattributes is tracked
git add .gitattributes
```
